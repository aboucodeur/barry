# BARRT

- barry is a command that started with passion,
        every time I go to consult the linode site for
        know the ip of my server to ssh me on it
        often I want it to be fast so I started using
        the command `nslookup` copy paste the address of the server on the
        sixth line second fields . So the command `barry [sommething.com]` was set up
        with an exploit of the `nslookup` command
